			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology plays a very important role today in the hotel industry. The advancement in information technology for example, has created an impact across the board right from top management to lower level staff like cleaners and chefs. The prestigious name ‘five stars’ associated with palatial and large hotels comes with spectacular services offered by the hotel i.e. ample parking, valet service, butler service, swimming pools, spa services like massages and manicure, unlimited room service, LCD screens which serve as an interface with the front office among others. .</p>
			<p>One vital system in hotel management is the Hotelogix which helps small and medium-sized establishments to manage their restaurant outlets, Front office, Housekeeping, Reservations, Points of sales, Credit cards and the entire website on a single platform (Dominici & Guzzo, 2). It basically has all features needed in hotel management and in running the hospitality industry efficiently. The hospitality management systems have evolved into refined, well incorporated, multi-discipline tools that are user friendly to guest and which have produce far more comprehensive and well-integrated system that cover virtually all areas even in a resort. .</p>
			<p>This has resulted into numerous benefits like having accurate data of the visiting guests which is very vital in the wake of this century where insecurity has been attacked from all sides, from terrorism, cyber crimes etc. Technology has impacted exponential growth in almost every sector of the hotel industry in this age, both local and international hotels have now banked on the power of the internet all round the clock so as to boost their sales and foster customer relations. Social media like twitter, Instagram and face book are used as means of popularizing the hotel’s services and strategies. These sites also have made it possible to maintain “after-sale’ relationships with former clients who are very crucial as far as recommending the hotel to others. .</p>
			<p>Tourists all over the globe have applauded the use of the hotel websites in facilitating bookings. In Europe, for instance, industry experts have forecasted that over a third of travel arrangements in 2010 were done via the net, through booking websites like Trip advisor, Expedia, Travelocity etc and online hotel subsidiaries. This new style has been replicated in most tourist Mecca’s around the world i.e. in Dubai, Hongkong, Disneyland, Mykonos etc (Dominici & Guzzo, 94). And the focus is now shifting to other tourist lucrative sites in Africa, Middle East and the pacific where online travel companies are not many as in Europe and USA. .</p>
			<p>Despite this obvious advantage of modern integrated systems many hotels have not harnessed the full advantage of this technology to maximize revenue opportunities. Many hotels also fail to support and secure them from fraudsters who are keen on corrupting databases. The kind of technology to be adopted by a particular hotel depends on the following factors among others: the intricacy of the hotel location, which in the past has required many diverse systems to interact with each other and the level of awareness among employees on use of technology and their competency in utilizing it .</p>
			<p>The hotel industry is growing at a significant rate compared to other sectors due to the rise in human tourism both locally and internationally and international business which has enhanced travel. The hotel industry is directly linked to the tourism industry which is responsible for a bigger percentage of most country’s revenue and foreign exchange source. There has being numerous researches carried out by experts in this industry in a bid to improve current performance and find solutions to deep seated problems that have harassed the industry over the years. The ICT technology has being the greatest invention that has speeded human freedom and welfare as far as the industry is concerned. Many efforts now trend towards embracing the most sophisticated of the ICT inventions some of which have proved successful in some countries. Communication has also been pointed as the spine that this industry leans on, bad communication leads to automatic failure; it is a service industry and first impression matter a lot. .</p>
