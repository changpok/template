			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Good communication is paramount in every operational business. Communication takes place all the time between staff, management and clients and is very essential in preventing conflicts and confusions. Communications makes sure that clients’ demands are met in time, and ensure smooth implementation of instructions from the management (James, 26).</p>
			<p>In the hotel industry, communication is mainly vertical where top decisions are made by the top management and implemented by the lower level employees. However, with increased competition and emphasis in proper management of employees’ communication is done horizontally, where all staff and management meet in a closed meeting raise their challenges and achievements then deliberate on them as a group and make recommendation on how to resolve them.</p>
			<p>There are two striking forms of communication within the hospitality industry, Communication between staff and clients and one between staff and the management (James, 2010). The former, is guided by the slogan ‘service with a smile’ where those employees like the receptionist, waiter, housekeeping staff and others who come in contact with the guests determine the fate of the hotel to future visits by the customer (James, 55). These individual should also be updated on the latest information and have a clue of services offered by each department for efficient referrals if need be and relaying sufficient information to the clients</p>
			<p>The other form of communication is between staff and the management of the hotel. The management should ensure free environment where the employees can easily express themselves, regular meeting and catch ups is necessary to foster this. The management should also implement several mechanisms of motivating employees through promotions, dinners, vacations, salary hikes when possible, incentives like loans, leaves, gifts for best performances among others. All these work to foster good relations between the management and the staff and getting rid of discontentment, which might stifle the operations of the business if not addressed in time.</p>
