			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>One of the solutions that I would like to propose is the age limit of when gaming should be started. First of all an eight year old should not be playing a I-Phone, or I-Pad. These are things that parents have to take control of. Look back when we were young, there are many things that we didn't have that teenagers or children's these days possess. For example the smart phones all over the globe. The children's catch interest in them and maybe start playing games like angry bird, floppy bird at the age of six, seven? These are things that must be prevented from the reach of children. Children's should be reading books or exercising and not sitting on the couch just swiping their fingers here and there for the whole day. There needs to be an age limit put onto violent video games. I would suggest maybe after college or maybe many more years after that, because some people just take gaming way too seriously. As E-sports it is fine, but as a normal player just seeking for something to do on spare time, it is not fine. I hope many games will put age limits on to games and maybe the government should really intervene, because children's learn the most in their early stages. Therefore they really shouldn't be just gaming all day and sitting in front of the computer. It is not only bad for the growth of the youth, but also it is hurting their body.</p> 
	<p></p>Another solution that I suggest is to ban the violent games. There are many games like puzzle games that could help train a youth's mind. However there are violent games and other games that have not much purpose but just to waste time and feel accomplished. Those games need to thrown out the door because not only are they time wasters but also they have brought no good to the society. They brought something to waste time and that's about it. Violent games have made more children nowadays more violent and that's an issue that will need to be fixed. Banning out these violent games could lead children's to have a healthier mind set. There won't be so much blood shatter games that makes people wonder what happens when they actually shoot someone in real life. Humans are curious creatures, sometimes they will bring what's in the game upon the real world and that's when everything becomes much more scary. The kid will become more violent and next thing you know he becomes a suspect for murderous activities. That is why I urge that violent games should be banned.
