			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>In our daily life, video gaming appears everywhere. It appears in places like the highway advertising board. Video games are being heavily advertised and that's why there are so many teenagers falling into the gaming world. In 1940 the first computer game was created. (Icheg) This was everything began. I remember back in the old days when we had our game in the late 1990s we had Pac man, Mario and things like that on the computer. Things have improved in the past twenty years drastically. I still my Nintendo Machine, and then all these game boys from Nintendo began to develop. I personally own the entire game boy that has ever been created, including game boy black/white, advanced, flip and now the NDS and 3DS. There were many other video games that sat us through childhood as well such as play station and computer games. There have been many games created over the years and now look at what we have. Modern times have everything in HD graphics. There is even 3d games coming up now. This is proof of that technology has improved. However with the improvement of this technology there has been a down effect as well. One of them was the life draining affect of video games. These video games became a part of a teenager that is born and raised in the 1990's and early 21st century. Till today some kids have phones that can play games. The world of video games has successfully invaded into the human world and is beginning to affect our lives deeply. There have been several of issues that have been occurring with the creation of more and more video games.</p>
