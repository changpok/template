			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, video games have caused more negative effects than they have done well. I hope people have recognized this issue by this time. There are many things that we need to as a civilization to help the gamers climb out of their world and contribute more to society. One more point here is that not everyone is like a crazy gamer, there are people that knows how to take multi task and can take care of everything. So my suggestions specifically is targeting gamers that stay at home and just do nothing all day but play games. Due to the fact that this has not only not improved their life but have made it worse. That is why I think games should be set to certain ages and certain groups of people. Also there shouldn't be violent games anymore, because not everyone can take the violence that has been given to them. Video gaming overall is just a bad thing to be doing and we are lucky to be living in such a advanced age, but unlucky due to the fact that technology has been holding many of teenagers back. We need to know how to use things in our advantage so that we can achieve success in our life. Video gaming has been a culture of us right now and hopefully people can wake up from the video gaming world and become a more successful person.</p>
