		<h1>Hospitality Business</h1>
		<p>Technology is essential to our daily life, with the rapid development of modern science and technology; our life became more simple and convenient. We are using technology to accomplish the need humans desired. Everyday people have new and different desires need to be accomplished, but human is hard to satisfy. For this reason, companies can produce more and more technology due to human desire. We can see the computer being powerful in our world. Ten years ago, the computers were not the same as today. It was merely a machine to type some words and surf the internet. However in modern times, we can see that the technical issues that has been occurring with computers ten years ago has decreased and we have added more and more features every year to the computer. I am arguing for our life. Without technology, our life might be inconvenient, or even worse. Even though we all know that will never happen, but because we rely so heavily on the technology, sometimes I worry that technology might have changed our life negatively. I am conscious that technology is influencing our live every day at every moment. Therefore our society might progress really slowly due to the fact we are so dependent on technology. On the other hand, technology brings our life more comfort and ease. We can reduce the amount of time spent on tasks that would normally require longer of time.</p>
		<p>The computer influence me the most to choose my major, I was in Electrical Engineering when I entered Michigan State University. When I was little, I love to play video games on the computer, it was the happiest moment back in the days, but sometimes computer wasn't working really well. We need to repair ourselves. Therefore I learn to solve computer technical issues naturally, like Internet connection problem or the hard disk is too full to save more tasks. It seemed simple, but I am curious why computer works different every time. I tried various methods to fix the computers with technical issues to let it run normally again. That was the amazing part for me, thus I have experience to solve various situations when computer is not working properly. After I get into electrical engineering, I had the passion and except Electrical Engineering wasn't the correct major for me, I began to fail class, lose the confidence on the homework and exam. Turned out my GPA started going down. I was really depressed and sad at that moment. It was difficult to bounce back from the low atmosphere around me. I talked to advisor and parents how to get my life get back on track, they said engineering wasn't the only area to use computer. Many other jobs need computer to finish different task too. Therefore I changed my major to Hospitality Business. Hospitality Business in general is hotel business management. We can learn how to service people, food and beverage management, or lodging management. The most important part is the service provided to the customer. We need to let every customer to feel they are being helped. when I encountered computer problems I was very curious on how things would work out if I tried different methods. and now I can use the curiosity to help customer. Also I can use the knowledge I have on computers to assist me to accomplish my goal.</p>
		<p>Computer has impacted my career the most. Before, we see students using notebooks to take notes, and every student has prepared pens and pencils for the class and ready to learn. But now, students use tablet or laptop to take notes, or do homework. It seems fast and easy, but sometimes students will not pay full attention on what the class is going on, and do their personal activities in the classroom. In the hospitality industry, it uses computers in a lot of places. For example, the accounting department needs computers to manage the money or to see if the company is having profit or not; the personnel department can use computers for manage people’s information, or post job information on the Internet to look for people who need to job, or intern. On the customer service, front desk people use computers to manage every customer’s reservation, and we can easily reserve a room from the computer, which is very convenient for people who don't have time to book a room from a phone. For the in- room service, we can use computers or tablets to control the air conditioner, TV, light, even certain and room service. Customers can feel comfortable and convenient at the same time, and it helps the hotel become more worthy and valuable to customer. </p>
		<p>The episode that related to my purpose is Steve Jobs. Steve Job is related to my project’s purpose because he created Apple and invented the iPad, iPod, iPhone, and iMac. It helped people monitor their lives. It also added a luxury to many people's lives. The I-products have helped technology move forward a huge step. Without it life would be inconvenient. Apple has developed from a small company to now one of the leaders of the market in technology. They have created many technologies such as rotating the screen on the phones, a little mp3 player named iPod for people can easy get access to music every where. They also have developed their own system, IOS. IOS is for iPhones and tablets to manage all the apps easily. Apple also invented MacBook, which looks like a laptop and has the system named OSX which is designed by Apple. Apple is very successful, and many companies try to make similar technology to make profits as well. Without these competitions, the technology would not have moved this fast. Ten years ago, Nokia was the biggest cell phone company, but now Apple and Samsung are coming out not only to share the market, but also influence most companies in the world. All of these happen only because the competitions we have in the market. </p>
		<p>Technology is really convenient and easy for people to use them, but we need to use it prudently. Some people use them on crime, like taking personal information, or eavesdrop other person conversation. Those of behavior are illegal. In other hand, People use the Internet can communicate with others from computer, like Facebook or Twitter. Computer also has various applications to send message to people. For example, Skype is a application we can talk and video call at same time, both feature are free and is high quality service for many years. Other application is MSN; we can text short message to each other, its really easy for people who don't have time to make phone call, or MSN have emotion icons to express the emotion. Everything has two sides, just like the technology, we have advantage to make our life to become easy and convenient, but we got disadvantage to let our personal information get easy access from other people. I think we can learn more between each two part and combine to a great experiment and use in our daily, so we can success in the future.</p>
