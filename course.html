		<h1>Course Retrospctive Project</h1>
		<p>Writing, Rhetoric and American Cultures 110: Science and Technology is really great class for this semester. Reading and writing are both very important category in higher education, also if people want to be successful is needed for our life. I took WRA 1004 last year, because I was an international student, for me English is my second language, which is hard for me to get expect it. This course helped me a lot to improve my writing skill, which I was not able to learn in the past semester. Writing can is always valuable in apply the job, or apply to get into graduate school and PhD. In this course, we asked to have 5 projects in our class, the main goal are giving us how to write in fluent, narrate, research and work in the group. The projects are Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project and the Course Retrospective Project, which is this one I am writing. </p>
	<p>At the first project we got is Lived Experiences Project. This Project is the first assignment give to us was a new form of writing. The project required us to write a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology that can impact our choice of a major or career at this presents time. This project helped to realize the technology not just a piece of material; also it is important to our life and our career or major. I choose computer to be the technology that influence me to my major.  I was telling a story how computer can influence my to decide my major which is Electrical engineering and turn out being Hospitality business which is my major right now. Through out the writing, we learning how to describe and write in detail. The writing skills require in my past semester is easier to what this course demand.  The major challenge for me is writing in detail, also the minimum required number of words was 1200, which is huge amount of words for me to describe a personal experience.  I struggle for few days to complete this project, but Dr. Daniels helped me a lot to accomplish the challenge. In this course, I have a noteworthy difference with the pervious writing projects I done before; we need to provide a web version of our projects.  The web making sources “Github” is using the fundamental HTML and CSS language to make the web page, that was quite a challenge for me to figure the method to finish my first web page. </p>
	<p>Second projects we got from the class were the cultural analysis proposal. This propose to this project is through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. There are many cultural artifact that can be discuss, such as a video game, a music video, a movie, and a TV show.  I chose how video game can influence many teenagers are obsessed with playing video games. They play twenty-four hours a days, never getting any rest. After that, Teenagers started to get un healthy and mess up their life. the social issue growing up larger in scope every day, also has become a common and serious problem for most of American family. Therefore, I came out two solutions, which can help teenager to stay away from the video game, conclude my suggestions specifically is targeting gamers that stay at home and just do nothing all day but play games. Due to the fact that this has not only not improved their life but have made it worse. That is why I think games should be set to certain ages and certain groups of people. At the end, I think Video gaming has been a culture or human and hope teenager wont be obsessed on it for every moment, and become a more successful person. This project require large amount of word to develop the our point of view, which is 1800 word court for the minimum. Not similar to the previous project is that we need to find source how this culture artifact going to influence society, that was a different experiment for me to write a paper like this one. This project also require web version and use “Github” as a web page development website to finish my web pages. In this project, I need to have different template to display different part of my proposal that was have large difference with the previous one. We need to type out some HTML language to finish this web page. It was a big challenge for me to complete culture analysis proposal. </p>
	<p>The third project is been the hardest and difficult project for my opinion. This was the first formal assignment for me. The purpose is using writing, reading, and researching to introduce my academic discipline or field to the audience, also used to create and communicate knowledge in the discipline or field I was chose to explore. This project is completely different with the previous two in different aspect. This paper is basically on the research academic field, and cannot include any personal opinion in the paper. For this in mind, I need to do lot of research to finish my project, I spent almost three weeks to complete the project and find out different kind of idea for my academic discipline, which is hospitality business. I needed to collect all the research work and combine to a formal research project, also the project is require 3000 words which is almost for me to type out all the words, but in the end, I finished in time. This project has similar technique to upload to the web version, I used what I learn on the previous project and upload it from the “Github” too. After I done this project, I cannot believe what I just complete, also I think this project help us to develop our research skill, which is useful in our future college academic progress.</p>
	<p>The fourth project is the best one and completely different with other project. This project is Multimedia Remix Project, which everyone separates into a different group and we need to film a video to present what we done which is based on Lived Experiences Report, Cultural Analysis Proposal, or Formal Research Report by someone in the group. My group chooses Lived Experiences Report, which is the stereotypes of Asians and their culture to become our issue, so the video should be detailing a personal narrative of linguistic and technological literacy. This project is mainly making a documentary about what we wrote before, so we can have chance to see what we done and to see where we can improve from previously. In the other hand, our thought and point of view not only can be address by the word, also we can film a documentary to speak our thought in another way. This project divides the student into group, so we can working with each other, and planning the topic and finishing the project with other people. I think in other academic course or in the job, we all need to know how to work with people, and this project introduced how to work with group, and cover each other, so we can finish the project that having best quality and best effort when we complete it.</p>
	<p>The last project is what I am writing right now, is course retrospective project. This project is writing what we done thought out the term and the reflection what we have learned and finished. For first one is Lived Experiences Project, we chose a technology to tell a story how this species technology influence for us to chose our major. The next one is the Cultural Analysis Project, we analysis a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. The third one is Formal Research Project, the first formal paper I had, also we need to research many source about our academic discipline, that led to a formal research project about my major Hospitality business. The last one is the Multimedia Remix Project. This project is divide student into groups then we have to film a documentary to show what we have done from the course.  Conclude all the point we have done, can turn out this Course Retrospective Project. Thought the course, I have learned how to be a great writer, the course develops my writing skill, which is useful in the future academic path and applying the jobs.</p>
