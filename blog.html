			<p>The purpose of the video we saw in class is for Randy Potts to share his uncle Ronnie’s who is a gay, and his uncle is suicide with others. In this video, Randy is being honest with himself to commit that his is a gay too. Randy also talked about how he feels about his uncle Ronnie take away his own life. This video is sending a messege that people are not alone, you always have someone can help you or be with you when you cannot accept by others or yourself. If you are a homosexual person, is ok to be accept by others and do not hurt yourself, because sucide not only hurt your own body which is not worthy, but also you will hurt others people who care about you. So do not always think selfish andalways ask for help anytime when we need to.</p>

			<p>1.	The people they try to target are teenager and people whom enthrallment on the online game and doesn't go to work or study everyday. In the movie we can see everyone is going to against a person who has no life and having high level in the game, and break the rule of game, so he can kill any character or the manager of the game in the Video game. The main character are getting kill too many time, lead to they can get to higher level and compete to the No life bad guy. The video shows different parts that teenager only play video game, then getting fat and unhealthy. Although in the ending they win the battle, but they become another no life person, and receive too many negative effect in the end, so is telling teenager don't enthrallment on the video game and eat healthy to get a fitness body are better choice.</p>
			<p>2.	The social issue is teenager are so enthrallment on the video game, many teenager is staying late or overnight just want to have more experiment to get higher level. Some people skip classes or work, only for the video game. That was wrong for people to do that, the society need them to keep working normally. People should having normal schedule to go to school for education, or going to company working for money, so they can have money to feed themselves or their family. Video game is good for kill time when people are bored, but not kill time on the normal daily schedule.</p>
			<p>3.	The video creators’ view is trying to tell us don't spend too much time on video game and do not being like a no life person, only video in everyday. In this video, four teenager was playing basketball on the court and having healthy body at first, but after they decide to play video every second, their world is changing. Just like the society, some people just want to play video game and don't want to study, show up in class, and do the homework. That turn out, they fail in the future, the do not know anything is happening in the world, and become ignoramus, so no one want to talk to the person or be friend with him. That was a serious in our life right now, because is getting worse in this few years, that is why the video creator want to tell us, and try to solve the problem. Therefore, people can help the person to get back on track, and being successful in the future. </p>
