			<p>The purpose of the video we saw in class is for Randy Potts to share his uncle Ronnie’s who is a gay, and his uncle is suicide with others. In this video, Randy is being honest with himself to commit that his is a gay too. Randy also talked about how he feels about his uncle Ronnie take away his own life.</p>
			<p>This video is sending a messege that people are not alone, you always have someone can help you or be with you when you cannot accept by others or yourself. If you are a homosexual person, is ok to be accept by others and do not hurt yourself, because sucide not only hurt your own body which is not worthy, but also you will hurt others people who care about you. So do not always think selfish andalways ask for help anytime when we need to.</p>

			<p>1.	The people they try to target are teenager and people whom enthrallment on the online game and doesn't go to work or study everyday. In the movie we can see everyone is going to against a person who has no life and having high level in the game, and break the rule of game, so he can kill any character or the manager of the game in the Video game. The main character are getting kill too many time, lead to they can get to higher level and compete to the No life bad guy. The video shows different parts that teenager only play video game, then getting fat and unhealthy. Although in the ending they win the battle, but they become another no life person, and receive too many negative effect in the end, so is telling teenager don't enthrallment on the video game and eat healthy to get a fitness body are better choice.</p>
			<p>2.	The social issue is teenager are so enthrallment on the video game, many teenager is staying late or overnight just want to have more experiment to get higher level. Some people skip classes or work, only for the video game. That was wrong for people to do that, the society need them to keep working normally. People should having normal schedule to go to school for education, or going to company working for money, so they can have money to feed themselves or their family. Video game is good for kill time when people are bored, but not kill time on the normal daily schedule.</p>
			<p>3.	The video creators’ view is trying to tell us don't spend too much time on video game and do not being like a no life person, only video in everyday. In this video, four teenager was playing basketball on the court and having healthy body at first, but after they decide to play video every second, their world is changing. Just like the society, some people just want to play video game and don't want to study, show up in class, and do the homework. That turn out, they fail in the future, the do not know anything is happening in the world, and become ignoramus, so no one want to talk to the person or be friend with him. That was a serious in our life right now, because is getting worse in this few years, that is why the video creator want to tell us, and try to solve the problem. Therefore, people can help the person to get back on track, and being successful in the future. </p>

			<p>The video is orginal broadcast for the Super Bowl commerical and is about Chrysler 200 driving across Detriot also having the famous singer Eninem singing for the commerical music. We can see the commerical not only the commerical, we can have different point of view in this commerical. </p>
			<p>This video is sending a messege that people are not alone, you always have someone can help you or be with you when you cannot accept by others or yourself. If you are a homosexual person, is ok to be accept by others and do not hurt yourself, because sucide not only hurt your own body which is not worthy, but also you will hurt others people who care about you. So do not always think selfish andalways ask for help anytime when we need to.</p>

			<p>Because of the horrible weather condition and the illness of Dr. Daniels, our writing class have been cancelling for over two weeks. However, this week we finally had our first class and we were introduced to the Writing, Rhetoric and American Cultures 110: Science and Technology.</p>
			<p>As an international student, although read and write in our second language could be hard at times, but it is still a fundamental skill that we have to have in order to success in our career. I took WRA 1004 last year, which severed as the introduction class to our writing.
			And after the introduction of this course, I realized we we’re going to be learning about are what I was not able to learn in the past semester.</p>
			<p>Although I somehow still worried about the lack of skills for me in a writing class, but I look forward to the classes in the future and am excited about what we’re going to be teach about.</p>
			<h1>Blog #5</h1>
			<p>Last week besides of the introduction to the course, we were also introduced to the technique, which we would be using throughout the semester, Github. Github was the website consists of templates and the others essential to build up a webpage. This is my first time using it and the start of this website was actually not too easy. I could tell that many people were confusing and didn’t get a single idea of what to do at the beginning. Dr. Daniels was really nice that she approached every student who raised their hand and explain the instruction and solved the problem for them. However, I wasn’t that lucky because I was sitting at the corner, and there were so many people having problem so that I couldn’t get the attention of Dr. Daniels. I decided to figure it out by myself when I go home. </p>
			<p>Moreover, we were also introduced to our first project, which is the Lived Experiences Project. This project serves as an easy start for us since it only wants us to write about our personal experience in an anecdote leads to the pursuing of our current major. I think the instructions was pretty straightforward and I already have brainstormed my idea so that it would be easier for me when I start to work on it. </p>

			<p>This week is our final week. Although this course doesn’t require us to take a final test like other subjects, but we do have lots of things that are needed to be turn in before Tuesday midnight. </p>
			<p>First of all is the course retrospective project. This project doesn’t require us to do any researches but reflect and review and we’ve done throughout the semester. Therefore, I think in general this is quite an easy task for me to accomplish. Next, the Codecademy is not difficult for me as well. Since I’ve been taking CSE before, I found out that most of the thing require us to do on the website is somewhat similar to what I learned in CSE. Followed by it is the blog, which require us to write at least 15 entries about the reflection of this course. I didn’t feel too much pressure for accomplishing this task since it’s only asking about our own opinion.</p>
			<p>Finally, it’s the design of our website which I found to be the most interesting part in our final week. By using the HTML skills we learned on Codecademy, we can change our background picture, the color and font of our content, and even the format of our webpage. It was really fun when I was looking for the best “outfit” for my blog.
