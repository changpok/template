			<p>The purpose of the video we saw in class is for Randy Potts to share his uncle Ronnie’s who is a gay, and his uncle is suicide with others. In this video, Randy is being honest with himself to commit that his is a gay too. Randy also talked about how he feels about his uncle Ronnie take away his own life.</p>
			<p>This video is sending a messege that people are not alone, you always have someone can help you or be with you when you cannot accept by others or yourself. If you are a homosexual person, is ok to be accept by others and do not hurt yourself, because sucide not only hurt your own body which is not worthy, but also you will hurt others people who care about you. So do not always think selfish andalways ask for help anytime when we need to.</p>

			<p>1.	The people they try to target are teenager and people whom enthrallment on the online game and doesn't go to work or study everyday. In the movie we can see everyone is going to against a person who has no life and having high level in the game, and break the rule of game, so he can kill any character or the manager of the game in the Video game. The main character are getting kill too many time, lead to they can get to higher level and compete to the No life bad guy. The video shows different parts that teenager only play video game, then getting fat and unhealthy. Although in the ending they win the battle, but they become another no life person, and receive too many negative effect in the end, so is telling teenager don't enthrallment on the video game and eat healthy to get a fitness body are better choice.</p>
			<p>2.	The social issue is teenager are so enthrallment on the video game, many teenager is staying late or overnight just want to have more experiment to get higher level. Some people skip classes or work, only for the video game. That was wrong for people to do that, the society need them to keep working normally. People should having normal schedule to go to school for education, or going to company working for money, so they can have money to feed themselves or their family. Video game is good for kill time when people are bored, but not kill time on the normal daily schedule.</p>
			<p>3.	The video creators’ view is trying to tell us don't spend too much time on video game and do not being like a no life person, only video in everyday. In this video, four teenager was playing basketball on the court and having healthy body at first, but after they decide to play video every second, their world is changing. Just like the society, some people just want to play video game and don't want to study, show up in class, and do the homework. That turn out, they fail in the future, the do not know anything is happening in the world, and become ignoramus, so no one want to talk to the person or be friend with him. That was a serious in our life right now, because is getting worse in this few years, that is why the video creator want to tell us, and try to solve the problem. Therefore, people can help the person to get back on track, and being successful in the future. </p>

			<p>The video is orginal broadcast for the Super Bowl commerical and is about Chrysler 200 driving across Detriot also having the famous singer Eninem singing for the commerical music. We can see the commerical not only the commerical, we can have different point of view in this commerical. </p>
			<p>This video is sending a messege that people are not alone, you always have someone can help you or be with you when you cannot accept by others or yourself. If you are a homosexual person, is ok to be accept by others and do not hurt yourself, because sucide not only hurt your own body which is not worthy, but also you will hurt others people who care about you. So do not always think selfish andalways ask for help anytime when we need to.</p>

			<p>Because of the horrible weather condition and the illness of Dr. Daniels, our writing class have been cancelling for over two weeks. However, this week we finally had our first class and we were introduced to the Writing, Rhetoric and American Cultures 110: Science and Technology.</p>
			<p>As an international student, although read and write in our second language could be hard at times, but it is still a fundamental skill that we have to have in order to success in our career. I took WRA 1004 last year, which severed as the introduction class to our writing.
			And after the introduction of this course, I realized we we’re going to be learning about are what I was not able to learn in the past semester.</p>
			<p>Although I somehow still worried about the lack of skills for me in a writing class, but I look forward to the classes in the future and am excited about what we’re going to be teach about.</p>
			<h1>Blog #5</h1>
			<p>Last week besides of the introduction to the course, we were also introduced to the technique, which we would be using throughout the semester, Github. Github was the website consists of templates and the others essential to build up a webpage. This is my first time using it and the start of this website was actually not too easy. I could tell that many people were confusing and didn’t get a single idea of what to do at the beginning. Dr. Daniels was really nice that she approached every student who raised their hand and explain the instruction and solved the problem for them. However, I wasn’t that lucky because I was sitting at the corner, and there were so many people having problem so that I couldn’t get the attention of Dr. Daniels. I decided to figure it out by myself when I go home. </p>
			<p>Moreover, we were also introduced to our first project, which is the Lived Experiences Project. This project serves as an easy start for us since it only wants us to write about our personal experience in an anecdote leads to the pursuing of our current major. I think the instructions was pretty straightforward and I already have brainstormed my idea so that it would be easier for me when I start to work on it. </p>
			<h1>Blog #6</h1>
			<p>This week is the first project Lived Experiences Project due, it is the first project we need to do in this course. The project required us to write a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology that can impact our choice of a major or career at this presents time. This project helped to realize the technology not just a piece of material; also it is important to our life and our career or major.</p>
			<p>For me, I choose computer to be the technology that influence me to my major. The story is mainly about that I was in Electrical engineering and swirch out to the Hospitality business in my second in Michigan State University. The toughness part for this project is that I have to finish a 1200 word essay. Which is a huge amount of words for me to describe the a experience and how technology inflence my decision to switch out my major. At the end, we need to provide a web version of our projects. The web making sources “Github” is using the fundamental HTML and CSS language to make the web page, that was quite a challenge for me to figure the method to finish my first web page.</p>

			<p>This week I am starting the second porject which is cultural amalysis proposal. The purpose for this project is through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to reconnoiter a social conflict, also how the conflict is significance on society. There are many cultural artifact that can be discuss, such as a video game, a music video, a movie, and a TV show. I chose how video game can influence many teenagers are obsessed with playing video games. They play twenty-four hours a days, never getting any rest. After that, Teenagers started to get un healthy and mess up their life. the social issue growing up larger in scope every day, also has become a common and serious problem for most of American family. Here are the idea I come out for this week, I think I can come out the soloution and conclusion for the next week. I also woking the codeacademy, which is interesting website and activtiy I can do for this course. I think the course will getting harder and challanger more next few week, but I am excited I can learn more new stuff for the course is going on.</p>
			<h1>Blog #8</h1>
			<p>This week I research for my culture analysis proposal solution and the conclusion for my project, I came out two solutions, which can help teenager to stay away from the video game, conclude my suggestions specifically is targeting gamers that stay at home and just do nothing all day but play games. Due to the fact that this has not only not improved their life but have made it worse. That is why I think games should be set to certain ages and certain groups of people. At the end, I think Video gaming has been a culture or human and hope teenager wont be obsessed on it for every moment, and become a more successful person. This project require large amount of word to develop the our point of view, which is 1800 word court for the minimum. Not similar to the previous project is that we need to find source how this culture artifact going to influence society, that was a different experiment for me to write a paper like this one. For this project require web version and use “Github” as a web page development website to finish my web pages. In this project, I need to have different template to display different part of my proposal that was have large difference with the previous one. We need to type out some HTML language to finish this web page.</p>
			<h1>Blog #9</h1>
			<p>This week we got a first formal research paper, when I got this instruction, I think I need to spend extra time to finish the project. I had never done a formal paper before, so I am frustrated when I am doing this project. The purpose for this project is using writing, reading, and researching to introduce my academic discipline or field to the audience, also used to create and communicate knowledge in the discipline or field I was chose to explore. This project is completely different with the previous two in different aspect. This paper is basically on the research academic field, and cannot include any personal opinion in the paper. After all I think I am done for this week, I need to take a break before I finished this project.</p>

			<p>This week is our final week. Although this course doesn’t require us to take a final test like other subjects, but we do have lots of things that are needed to be turn in before Tuesday midnight. </p>
			<p>First of all is the course retrospective project. This project doesn’t require us to do any researches but reflect and review and we’ve done throughout the semester. Therefore, I think in general this is quite an easy task for me to accomplish. Next, the Codecademy is not difficult for me as well. Since I’ve been taking CSE before, I found out that most of the thing require us to do on the website is somewhat similar to what I learned in CSE. Followed by it is the blog, which require us to write at least 15 entries about the reflection of this course. I didn’t feel too much pressure for accomplishing this task since it’s only asking about our own opinion.</p>
			<p>Finally, it’s the design of our website which I found to be the most interesting part in our final week. By using the HTML skills we learned on Codecademy, we can change our background picture, the color and font of our content, and even the format of our webpage. It was really fun when I was looking for the best “outfit” for my blog.
