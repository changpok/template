			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Through my suggestions, I think the anticipated results will be great. There will be more and more people becoming less violent, however this is a huge impact to the gamers in their world and I am sure that most gamers will oppose the ideas that I have proposed. There are maybe thousands or maybe even millions of players playing battlefield and other similar games. To tell people to stop gaming, for some people is taking their life away and that's one thing that we have to watch out for. These people really need to learn that gaming is not everything about life; there are various other things that are waiting to be done. I think the results of these banning games and setting game ages would help our youths move on to a more successful path. They need time to experiment with different clubs, activities to fully understand what they want to do for their future and thus could go in to college knowing what they want to do. They need to have a goal, a dream that they would want to accomplish. This will definitely help them get motivated and help them move in the right path. Everyone has different life styles I agree with that, but playing games until your 20's 30's and still live with your parents is not that life style. If one can support them throughout this effect it would be great. That is approximately the goal of my plans. I want people to get off gaming for a while and just live their life. Learn to communicate with others and support them. </p>
