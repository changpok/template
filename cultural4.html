			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>There are several issues that have been occurring with gaming. One of the issue was that there are so many violent games out there right now like, battlefield. There are many first player games that make teenagers believe they were in that world. Many of these games have made kids become more violent. I know sometimes when I play games I get so mad and slam the table because of a bad play. This is an example of video games influencing teenagers. Video games could make a teenager really hot tempered. It could give him a sense of violence. I have seen my brother lose in FIFA and break a chair right in front of my very own eyes. He was so mad and he even took a knife out, and I had to hold him down. This is probably one of the most negative effects that video games can have on teenagers and children.</p>
			<p>Another issue with video gaming is the problem with anti socializing. There are teenagers like my cousin that just goes home right after school to play video games until late night and then sleep. There daily life basically revolves around, school, eat gaming and sleep. They don't do anything else but these things repeatedly throughout the course of their life. This is a very serious issue due to the fact that they will never learn to socialize with the general public. They have no socializing abilities and they become what we call a "loner". This does not help United States move in the right way. There are of course many others that aren't gamers and have good capability in school and everything else of their lives. What I am saying is that with the increase of video games, there have been a trend of more people living in their own gaming world and won't come out to talk to others. If this trend continues, it could be a very scary trend that we are looking at. Although there are several issues with that is known, but there hasn't been much action taken towards this issue yet. I want to suggest some steps that could possibly prevent the world of gaming from damaging our youths from growing into successful men. </p>
