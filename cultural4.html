			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>There are several issues that have been occurring with gaming. One of the issue was that there are so many violent games out there right now like, battlefield. There are many first player games that make teenagers believe they were in that world. Many of these games have made kids become more violent. I know sometimes when I play games I get so mad and slam the table because of a bad play. This is an example of video games influencing teenagers. Video games could make a teenager really hot tempered. It could give him a sense of violence. I have seen my brother lose in FIFA and break a chair right in front of my very own eyes. He was so mad and he even took a knife out, and I had to hold him down. This is probably one of the most negative effects that video games can have on teenagers and children.</p>
