			<p>There are several ways in which the hotels standards in terms of food handling can be improved on. This paper examines the HACCP- Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and the Food Safety Challenges and Initiatives in the Dubai Hospitality Industry. The HACC- is a management system where food safety is looked into by analyzing and preventing chemical, biological and physical risks during raw material production, handling and procurement, processing, distribution and even the final stage of consumption.  The HACCP standards are much relevant in the hotel industry, just like in the Agricultural sector. Currently, a lot of people from different parts of the world check in and out of the hotels and are dependent on hotel meals, thus the chances of contamination finding its way to the hotel space is very high. The room services, the beverages in restaurants and other food outlets are the most exposed places where contamination can easily occur. To counter this problem the following has to be looked into: Immediate investigation, freezing standards and monitoring cooking. .</p>
<p>When food substances arrive at the hotel, the inspection unit should immediately proceed to carry out check to make sure that the meat, the ingredients and other food stuffs are fit and safe for human consumption. Packaging, sealing, labeling and transportation means should also be investigated. There are certain freezing standards for each food type, for instance, meat should be frozen at 41o Celsius under HACCP guidelines so as to prevent bacteria from thriving. Such details should also be incorporated when checking the safety of the food. Fruits and other perishables should not have exceeded certain days since harvesting.</p>
<p>Apart from cooking to ensure that the food is delicious and tasty to every visitor, there are certain cooking guidelines which should be adhered to. For examples, when cooking meat, HACCP recommends that the internal temperature should rise above 160 0 Celsius so as to kill all the bacteria present in the meat. Any leftovers should be frozen and re-cooked next time before consumption. Generally, HACCP standards are very important in the hotel and tourism industry as it ensure compliance with both national and international rules on hygiene which work to minimize the break out of disease caused by food stuffs. Its aim is to guard the health of both staff and guests and in the process boosting the efficiency and effectiveness of business. .</p>
<p>The other source on how to improve hotel standards is the Food Safety Challenges and Initiatives in the Dubai Hospitality Industry (Balakrishnan, 62). It is an initiative developed by the Dubai hotels operating in the United Arab Emirates based on the international themes of safety management of challenges and solutions. Based on a research watched over by the Dubai Municipality Food Control Department it was deducted that many hotels and hospitality business do not manage food as required despite minimal training on food handling for their employees. This then prompted the management of these hotels to take an initiative where they get training on the HACCP standards of food handling then come and pass the knowledge to their staff and supervise the implementation of these standards. The Dubai hotel industry has therefore come up with two vital strategies to ensure this end is achieved: mandatory training for the people in charge of all food businesses and the implementation of food protection management coordination (Balakrishnan, 78). .</p>
<p>As the case in other industries, the hotel industry has not been free from Challenges, some of which have proved insurmountable and plagued the industry for years. They include the following: labor shortage characterized by low level of skill and competency yet higher demand for wages and salaries, soaring costs of construction and costs of furnishing, buying equipments and even food substances, Sophisticated information technology and integrated systems that are not even understood and used by the staff and Changing demographics which implies varied tastes, preferences , needs and styles among many others. .</p>
<p>To resolve these issues, the hotel management should come up with the following strategies: Implementation of friendly user technology systems and software trainings for employees periodically, Major ways of bolstering employee motivation through incentives, leaves, promotions, vacations, dinners etc, Buying necessities in bulk to cut on the costs and maintaining good and steady relations with the suppliers, Implementation of efficient communication channels to curb on staff conflict and constant confusion along with other specific-kind of strategies gripping particular hotels.</p>
