		<h1>Multimedia Remix Project</h1>
		<p>For this Multimedia Remix Project, our group selects the stereotypes of Asians and their culture to become our issue. For myself I am Asian student who is study aboard in the United States, l think the concern we choose is really a focus problem in the United States. The issue is composing on the Korean singer PSY who has success in the United States, I can tell from his song “Gangnam Style” have strong Stereotypes of Asians and their culture. The achievements from PSY I know the American is still have same thought of Asian in their mind. The problems that encounter in organizing and composing the documentary is Americans did not realize they are having stereotype of Asian people, its hard for people to commit their fault, so we use the video and interview to analyze the problem, so that shows the stereotype in the attention of American people. The main role for the audience is let them know the that will be a prejudice for Western cultured people that supports the western cultured participants, and immorality consideration for the Asian audience. The audience needs to know the conflict are there, so that they need to accept different point of views from different way so they wont have their biases. </p>
 		<p>The main reason our group to chose this topic is that in the Western entertainment business, they only have Asians are having lack grammar and make fun to use of the English, also they think the Asians are not good looking, they are small eyes short and not good looking. It is difficult to find a sexy, handsome, or beautiful Asian Actor and/or Actress in the Hollywood movie, TV show, or music video, any communication media in the United States. The most challenging part of the project for me is hard to find an American friends or person for me to finish my interview, because its hard to make friend with American that some of American think Asian is not good at English or the culture difference between two different country people. Our group takes a systematic approach to finish our project. First we chose our topic and discuss how we can finish every part of the video. Next, we interview different non-Asian people for each person and get their thought and opinion in the interview. Thereafter, we edited the project each part for every group member, also add more thought to make the project more dynamic. After all we finished all the part the project is completed. </p>
		<p>The most beneficial research resources for me is that we get to know how Western people think about the Asian culture. We know that Western people think Asian is funny and lack of grammar to use English, also how strong of stereotype of Asian people and their culture in their mind. The least beneficial is how eastern people think about the Western culture, because most of Asian has their own group and does not communicate with other, so they do not have so much thought of other culture.</p>
		<p>Working is this group is fruitful. First of all, we show our 100% effort in this project, every person finish their part in time and love to collaborate with each other. Second of all, we use text, email or the D2L working area is how we communicate other group members, then everyone is love to say their impression and other will give the opinion or how the idea can become better.</p>
		<p>I think I did my best on this project. I help on the introduction, interview, editing and communicate with other member, it’s well planned every part and I finished 100% effort on it. If I got more time or do it over again, I think we will come out more different kind of idea and thought in the interview, but I think the project is extremely great for how we have done.</p>
		<p>The most effective aspect in the documentary’s is the introduction, because its really interesting and attracting others attention in the first part of documentary. PSY is really stereotype to the western people of the Asian culture, so I choose him for our design decision.</p>
